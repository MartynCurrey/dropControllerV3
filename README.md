## Introduction
I started drop photography many years ago and started developing the dropController when I wanted better control of the collisions and splashes. I found other drop devices limited and difficult to use and so started to develop my own system.

dropControllerV3 is now a mature, well tested water drop photograpy device. It was developed with ease of use in mind, and over time has been refined and updated to meet the needs of all droppers; whether beginner, intermediate, or advanced.

The dropController systems allow you to start as simple as you wish and become as advanced as you want. dropController allows you to start in a very simple way but does not limit you as you progress to advanced drops.

dropControllerV3 features:
- 6 valve ports
- Compatible with 12v and 24v valves. (Requires matching PSU).
- Camera and flash trigger ports
- 2 auxiliary trigger ports
- Advanced shutter trigger modes
- 3 independent trigger controls
- Loop Mode using delta values (easy collisions)
- Auto save drop data
- Auto save main settings
- Compatible with cameras that have a wired shutter remote function
