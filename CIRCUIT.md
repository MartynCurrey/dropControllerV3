# Circuit Diagram

The dropControllerV3 circuit is fairly simple and building one should not be that difficult for anybody with any kind of electronics or Arduino experience. It will be little harder if you are totally new to electronics but not impossible. dropControllerV3 has been designed to make construction straight forward using commonly available components. Kits are usually available from www.dropcontroller.com if you prefer not to source all the parts yourself.

I tried to keep the circuit as simple as possible and have used commonly available parts. For example  4N35s, IRL540Ns (or IRLZ44Ns) mosfets, and the 3.5mm stereo sockets are the same for the camera and flash connections. 

The circuit allows the use of 12v and 24v power input. This means the same circuit can be used with either 12v valves or 24v valves. 
**CAUTION:** Do not mix  valves of different voltages on the same circuit, match he valves to the power supply; 12v power with 12v valves, and 24v power with 24v valves.
